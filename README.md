Welcome to a music site where you can share your electronic creations with the world!

This is a project for my Final Exam at SoftUni Software University. It's about a site where DJs and producers can share their electronic creations with the world. The site includes the following functionalities:

1. Dashboard: where all tracks except private ones are visible. Users can listen, share and like. 
2. Catalogue: a private area for users where they have access to CRUD operations for all their tracks, as well as the option to set chosen tracks to private.
3. User profile details.
4. The site uses waveform graphics for tracks, similar to SoundCloud.
